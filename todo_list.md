# Appwrite Integration TODO List

Here are the next steps to fully integrate Appwrite and enhance the application:

- [ ] **Protect Other Routes:** Implement authentication checks in pages like `app/write/page.tsx` using the `useAuth` hook to redirect unauthenticated users.
- [ ] **Appwrite Database Integration:**
    - [ ] Set up Appwrite Database collections (e.g., for posts/content, extended user profiles if needed).
    - [ ] Replace placeholder data fetching functions (like `getUserContent` in `lib/data.ts` and used in `app/profile/[username]/page.tsx`) with actual Appwrite database queries using the `databases` service.
    - [ ] Update components (like `ContentList`) to work with data fetched from Appwrite.
- [ ] **Refine Profile Page:**
    - [ ] Allow viewing other users' profiles (requires fetching data, possibly from a public database collection, rather than just checking against the logged-in user).
    - [ ] Consider creating an "extended profiles" collection in Appwrite DB to store `bio`, `username` (if desired and unique), `publicationCount`, etc., and fetch/display this data.
- [ ] **Address Peer Dependency Warnings:** Investigate and potentially resolve the React/date-fns peer dependency warnings shown during `pnpm add appwrite`.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Review and potentially enhance error handling across components interacting with Appwrite.
- [ ] **Loading States:** Improve loading state indicators (e.g., using skeletons) in components that fetch data asynchronously. (Basic skeleton added to profile page, review others).
